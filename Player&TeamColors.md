# Player & Team Colors
Player and teams colors are automatically assigned, dependent on the game mode. This is done intentionally to provide a clear visual distinction. 

In multiplayer games, colors are assigned by descending Openskill value. A player cannot pick a specific color to play as, it's dictated by team number.

## Color Palettes
-   There are different predefined palettes (`ffaColors`, `survivalColors`, `teamColors`) for all game modes.
 -   Special colors are assigned for AI factions like _Scavenger_ and _Raptor_, as well as neutral factions
 
### Special Colors
| Hex Code  | Special Color  |
|-----------|-------------|
| #004DFF   | Armada Blue |
| #FF1005   | Cortex Red |
| #6809A1   | Scav Purple |
| #CC8914   | Raptor Orange |
| #7F7F7F   | Gaia Grey    |
| #0CE818   | Legion Green |
 
### Alternative Modes
These are alternate modes where player/team colors are randomized, obscured, or standardized to alter identify/visibility.
- **Disco Mode** `disco`: Randomizes team colors periodically (every 2 minutes), using`shuffleAllColors`
- **All Red** `allred`: Yeah everyone is red. 
- **Anonymous** `local`:  Each player is given local random colors for all other players so there isn't uniform coloring. For example, Player 1 will see Player 2 as "Red", but Player 3 will see Player 2 as "Blue". 

### Automatic Color Generation
Teams in BAR will have a main color, or a "theme" color. BAR generates slight variations to a team's main color to make them visually distinct and avoid repetitive colors while not having drastic changes that would make colors unrecognizable. This variation is achieved by randomly modifying the RGB values of each "main" color, then converting it back to Hex.

Process is
-   `hex2RGB(hex)` converts a color's hex code into an RGB triplet (Red, Green, Blue) that ranges from 0 to 255.
-   A random value is added to each RGB component (Red, Green, Blue), defined as: `math.random(-variation, variation).`variation` is the delta value.
- Level of variation is controlled by `colorVariationDelta` (default is 128). It increases over each cycle to maintain uniqueness incase the color palette gets weird.
-   If all available colors are exhausted it resets to the first color and the variation amplitude increases, making new colors more distinct.

### Team Colors
Teams are assigned a main color palette based on the number of teams (up to eight teams), these are unique color palettes (e.g., Cool tones for Team 1, Warm tones for Team 2).
-   Nested structure:
    -   `teamColors[x]` â†’ Total number of teams (e.g., `2`, `3`, `4`, etc.).
    -   Each sub-table corresponds to a team and holds a list of hex colors.

## Code
Colors are handled by a gadget that can be found here: https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason/blob/master/luarules/gadgets/game_autocolors.lua 

-   `hex2RGB`: Converts a hexadecimal color string to an RGB table.
-   `shuffleTable`: Randomizes the order of colors within a table.
-   `shuffleAllColors`: Randomizes all color palettes when anonymous mode is active.
