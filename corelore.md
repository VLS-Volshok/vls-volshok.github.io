# **Cortex: Order, Power, Merit**

The Cortex is a galactic faction that embodies logic, honor, and stoic resolve. It is a culture and civilization rooted in chivalric ideals, where strength must be earned, and is a reflection of discipline and purpose. Tradition forms the backbone of Cortex society, acting as a moral compass and safeguard against the increasing standardization, digitalization, and automation in modern times.  The very human guiding ideologies serve to preserve their core values as they spread across the stars. 

Although futuristic and in constant search for improvement, the Cortex remain steadfast in upholding principles of honor, duty, and integrity. This ideology seeks to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated. Power is a tool that must be earned, it cannot be given. Merit dictates social status, far moreso than wealth. Laws, and adherence to them, is the cornerstone of their ordered society. This collection of very human moralities form the unifying Echelon Code—a doctrine of law and chivalry, which connects the various facets of Cortex Society. 

However, the Cortex are not a monolithic entity but a coalition of factions, each wielding political, military, and economic authority in their search for a balance of power that will not lead to civil war or dictatorship. They are overseen by the High Conclave, charged with governing Cortex society and enforce its laws.  These factions often clash over strategies and philosophies while remaining unified in their mission to further Cortex society and defend their homeworlds.

## **Regions of Cortex Space**

### **1. The Primaris Systems**

The Primaris Systems form the heart of the Cortex, home to its political, military, cultural, and industrial centers. These systems house the majority of the civilization, and are generally lightly defended, a combination of smaller fortress moons, defined industrial hubs covered in AFUs, and ancient halls where the Echelon Code is upheld. 

- **Lex Primus** : The political and cultural capital of the Cortex. This planet-city serves as the seat of the Echelon Code, with towering spires reaching into orbit. The member of the Cortex High Conclave are here.

-   **Latheworlds**: A vast network of industrial planets responsible for producing the majority of Cortex’s military hardware. Overseen by the Construction Stratum, these worlds are the lifeblood of Cortex industry and research efforts.

-   **Artturisir**: Artturisir is revered among the Cortex for its punishing environment and rigorous testing grounds. Recruits trained here are dubbed “Crimson-Born,” known for their endurance, precision, and adaptability in harsh terrain warfare.  It stands as a brutal crucible for the Cortex's military elite. Its scarlet plains, labyrinthine fissures, and contested water zones test recruits in siege tactics, resource control, and endurance. Here, warriors are given the chance to earn their power, learn that survival requires order, and the red dust only remembers those who follow the Echelon Code.

### **2. The Nebula Systems**

The Nebula Systems represent the Cortex's Eastern frontier, a region of ongoing exploration, terraforming, and adaptation. These systems are a source of both opportunity and ideological tension, as pioneers and visionaries challenge the rigid traditions of the Primaris Systems.

-   **Keram's Horizon**: A faction of explorers and terraformers who view the Nebula Systems as critical for Cortex expansion and survival. Their emphasis on adaptability often puts them at odds with traditionalist factions.

-   **The Bellum Order**: A chivalric and militant order that sees the Nebula Systems as a proving ground for honor and duty. They provide protection for colonization fleets and settlers, ensuring that Cortex ideals endure in uncharted territories.
- 
-   **Enborelde**: A planet in the Nebula Systems, part of the early Terraforming crusades.  It's modelled after OT, and could eventually serve as an agricultural hub.

### **3. The Line Worlds**

The Line Worlds are Western battlefront against the Armada, a cluster of systems where the Cortex’s resolve is tested daily.  Many of these worlds are devoid of life, encompassing nothing but rocks, craters, and unreclaimed metal as ownership is continuously traded between Cortex and Armada.  Others are mirrored amalgamations of what they once were, artificial landscapes terraformed to hide the battle scars, then duplicated to save time and effort.

Across their landscapes exist massive fortifications, mountains of porc, and nano turret farms churning endless battalions of warriors to contest the Armada forces. Commanding and battling on the Line Worlds is very honorable, and required for all leadership figures. The three main defense factions that hold the Line Worlds are:

-   **The Fortwatchers**: Insert Cool Lore here
-   **The Sentinel Drivers**: Insert Cool Lore here
-   **The Forgeclans**:  Insert Cool Lore here
